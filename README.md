# Choose_color
Use pi to send data to Arduino Mega 2560 R3 to change the color of a neopixel ring. Pi uses tkinter color chooser so the color spectrum is available. Neopixel ring will then change to that color
I used a 24 pixel neoring, but the INO can be adjusted for more or less pixels.

Neoring connections:
5V connected to 5V header on Arduino with 104 cap
Ground connected to ground
Data input connected to pin 6 on Arduino with 1k resistor
USB is connected directly to Pi
I used a Pi 3 model B
